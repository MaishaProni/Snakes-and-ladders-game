#####*********Snakes and Ladders Game*********#####

This is a Snakes and Ladders game implemented using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) in C++.
The game allows 2 to 4 players to compete, rolling dice to move across the board while encountering snakes and ladders that change their positions. 
The first player to reach square 100 wins the game! The project features an interactive menu, a visual representation of the board, and player tokens, making it a fun and engaging experience.  

The game transitions smoothly between different states:
- **Menu**: Choose the number of players.
- **Game**: Roll the dice, move across the board, and aim for square 100.
- **Game Over**: Displays the winner with an option to restart or exit.  

This project demonstrates the use of SFML for graphics and event handling. To run this project, ensure SFML is properly set up in your development environment.
Feedback and contributions are welcome!
